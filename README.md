# VisitNYC

This is a project that is intended to be a website used for a guide to travel and explore NYC. You can select whether you want to be have a local or tourist account. In the menu, users can find what categories they want to visit and are given plenty of information. Local accounts can post recommendations and all accounts can comment on the recommendations. There is also a map showing locations for the places in the menu. They have icons so users know what category it is in.
